# Emotion Detection: Happy and Sad Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images based on emotional content, specifically distinguishing between happy and sad expressions. The model's accuracy in recognizing these emotions will enhance applications in mental health monitoring, social media analysis, and human-computer interaction.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HoomKh/Emotion-Detection-HappySad-Classification.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Emotion-Detection-HappySad-Classification
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To classify images based on their emotional content, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and placed in the specified directory.
2. Run the model training script:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
3. Use the trained model to make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should contain labeled images categorized into 'happy' and 'sad' expressions. Ensure your dataset is organized into two folders: `happy` and `sad`, each containing relevant images.

## Model Training
The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Training involves the following steps:
1. Preprocessing the images (resizing, normalization, etc.).
2. Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Training the CNN model on the training set.
4. Validating the model on the validation set.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model distinguishes between happy and sad expressions.

## Results
The results of the model, including accuracy and loss graphs, will be saved and can be viewed in the `results` directory. Example predictions and their corresponding confidence scores will also be provided.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Ensure your changes are well-documented and tested.
